  <h1><em>The Mem-Bot</em></h1>
  <p><em>The Mem-Bot</em> is a program designed by, well you know who. This project has 1 and only one goal, <strong>make memrise points fast</strong>. <em>The Mem-Bot</em> is quite easy to run, you download the .exe (<em>The Mem-Bot</em>) and you followed the instructions on <em>The Mem-Bot</em> and ta-da, <em>The Mem-Bot</em> will get you <strong>infinite points</strong>. How to run <em>The Mem-Bot</em> and to view the changelog click <a href="setup.html">Here</a> and how <em>The Mem-Bot</em> has been created can be found <a href="workings.html">Here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Purchase</h2>
  <p>If you want <em>The Mem-Bot</em> you should talk to me in person and I will sell the bot to you. I could also <strong>Sell you points</strong> for a cheaper ammount. I could give you addons with additional functionality some are listed below.</p>
  <ul class="container">
    <li><em>The Mem-Bot</em> contains an option called <em>'threading'</em>. This essentially allows <em>The Mem-Bot</em> to run the same quiz multiple times on the same device making the bot many times faster than it's already ridiculous speed!</li>
    <li><em>The Mem-Bot</em> has multiple versions which improve <em>The Mem-Bot</em> in some way shape or form which could be sold.</li>
    <li><em>The Mem-Bot</em> is an ever adapting piece of software which will most likely support newer courses as they are launched.</li>
    <li>What if Memrise changes the website? Well the entire <em>The Mem-Bot</em> would have to be redesigned so it would be a bit of work.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Is this safe?</h2>
  <p>Short answer is <strong>yes</strong>. If you are a bit concerned I have arranged an entire list specifying the <strong>safety features</strong> which are listed below.</p>
  <ol class="container">
    <li><em>The Mem-Bot</em> has no way to me any information.</li>
    <li><em>The Mem-Bot</em> is going to be ran on a new account so any harm would be minimal anyway.</li>
    <li>I know how <em>The Mem-Bot</em> runs and all the details so I can see if someone has been using the bot for a long time (so can you!).</li>
    <li>I have created a web page (<a href="limiter.html">Click Here!</a>) and depending on what is on the website (which I can control) the bot runs or it doesn't.</li>
    <li>I have fine control over everythong including what accounts can use <em>The Mem-Bot</em>, which courses you can run, if you have access to threads and version control.</li>
    <li>Point 5 essentially means if you break a rule I can revoke your access from my bot using a remote website (<a href="limiter.html">This One!</a>)</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>Well <em>The Mem-Bot</em> I feel might be just a tad bit too <strong>powerfull</strong> to be let free so I implemented <strong> safety features and rules</strong>. So here's the list!</p>
  <ol class="container">
    <li>DO NOT share ANY CODE WITH ANYBODY FOR ANY REASON unless officially allowed to.</li>
    <li>DO NOT modify or delete the bot software.</li>
    <li>DO NOT use the bot for long periods of time!</li>
    <li>Make no attempts at manipulating the .exe file as you will be unsucessfull.</li>
    <li>DO NOT share the knowledge about this bot in any capacity, This includes functional details, how good the bot is, how it may operate and aything in the like.</li>
    <li>DO NOT brag about your points using this bot.</li>
    <li>DO NOT tell anyone you have the bot.</li>
  </ol>
