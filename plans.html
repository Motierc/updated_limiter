    <h1>The plans</h1>
    <p>Don't have many. That is part of the problem in the development of this project, the thing is so good already what else could I possibly add? I am sure that you right there probablly have some fantastic ideas, I mean you are smart right? If you think you have a good idea, talk to me and most likely in the next update your idea aswell as your name (if you want it) will be on the changelog. For now this is what is to possiblly become of this intersesting and fantastic project.</p>

<ul>
    <li><h2>Making a GUI</h2><p>A GUI or a graphical user interface makes stuff look a lot nicer (usually). Instead of the program run with a black background and a white text color, I wish to make the program look a lot nicer with buttons and boxes which are arranged simply and conviniently.</p></li>
    <li><h2>Accompanying .txt file</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The file could store preferences.</li>
            <li>Has a randomly generated (encrypted) key to make sure the file hasn't been modified and to identify the file.</li>
            <li>Keeps track of when the bot has been used, how long, ammount of threads, courses ran, and points generated. This can be analytically analysed to make the <em>The Mem-Bot</em> way better, faster and more convinient to use and run.</li>
            <li><strong>Everything</strong> is encrypted and only the hashing salt can decrypt it.</li>
            <li>Requested each week maybe month from every <em>The Mem-Bot</em> user.</li>
            <li>The randomly generated (encrypted) key is spread out throughout the file so if the file has been modified the program stops working.</li>
        </ol>
    <li><h2>Add an 'add course' feature</h2><p>You may or may not know that it takes quite some effort to add a new course to <em>The Mem-Bot</em> so what if I can make a feature where anyone can program the course onto <em>The Mem-Bot</em> by just running <em>The Mem-Bot</em> and telling it the answers once.</p></li>
